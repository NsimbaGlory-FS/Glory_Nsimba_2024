    <p class="fred">
      How We Got to Now book coverIn this illustrated history, Steven Johnson
      explores the history of innovation over centuries, tracing facets of
      modern life (refrigeration, clocks, and eyeglass lenses, to name a few)
      from their creation by hobbyists, amateurs, and entrepreneurs to their
      unintended historical consequences. Filled with surprising stories or
      accidental genius and brilliant mistakes — from the French publisher who
      invented the phonograph before Edison but forgot to include playback, to
      the Hollywood movie star who helped invent the technology behind Wi-Fi and
      Bluetooth–How We Got To Now investigates the secret history behind the
      everyday objects of contemporary life.
    </p>

    <p class="fred">
      Johnson examines unexpected connections between seemingly unrelated
      fields: how the invention of air-conditioning enabled the largest
      migration of human beings in the history of species — to the cities such
      as Dubai or Phoenix, which would otherwise be virtually uninhabitable; how
      pendulum clocks helped trigger the industrial revolution; and how clean
      water made it possible to manufacture computer chips. — from Penguin
      Random House.
